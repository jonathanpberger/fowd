# Intro to Git Skillshare Notes

## "Staging" is an ambiguous word.
  - `CI` == "commit"
  - CI == "CI Monitor"
  
## People are interested in 
  - Team workflow
  - Ettiquette
  
### Useful Techniques
- git reset HEAD^

### Workflow Management
- feature branches
- deploying from master
- deploy branches 

- "Enough Git to let you use Heroku"

- create install instructions that I can refer back to.
- "Check out the tutorial; if you have Git installed and can get up and going, try to play along. If you can't get it on the first try, put it away and pay attn to me. You can always get back to it later.

- setup w/ Git Config.
- jpb should open files in Textmate w/ the Mac OS dialog. Terminal is scary.
- "Did you know you can open files in textmate in the terminal?"

# Metaphors
- git is a stream where you track things
- fruit
- stagecoach
- chairlift
- telegram / lincolns death: "Git for Abolitionists".

# Demo
- jeckyl
- sinatra
- node.js
- pivotpong

# Pacing
- anchor the work. do something real, early.
- skip `git init`, just mention that it's not magic. This could come *in media res*.
- What's the Unit of Change?
- kill the "changesets" bit

## "Push" needs heroku.
- fork
- push to own repo
- clone comes at the end
- pre-cook the repo at differente steps
- `stash` and `branch` are for the web tutorial, not the presentation
- branching workflow should be in - MG
- "I don't know a designer who could push to Heroku"
- skip early details. no other VCS stuff
- gitx commit log view is core
- git cares about this / doesn't care about that
- skip `rebase`
