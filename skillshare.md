# Code Management for Designers

!SLIDE
# What it says on the tin
> Become a more powerful designer by learning how to deploy your sites with Git and cloud hosting solutions like Heroku.

!SLIDE
# The Plan - 40m
- run through common workflows
- not get bogged down in specifics

!SLIDE
# What does Version Control do?
- It allows you to "save" work and revert back to old versions.
- It helps teams of people work on the same codebase without clobbering each others changes.
- It also allows branching, to help people experiment safely.

!SLIDE
## Why do I want to use it?
  - To **integrate** w/ teams and share work.
  - To **create "savepoints"** to return to known-good states (like in a video game).
  - To **experiment using branches** w/o disturbing the main line.
  - To retain **access to old versions** of the software.
  - To facilitate **sane workflow**.

!SLIDE
# Why Git instead of another VCS?
- Its awesome at branching.
- Its fast and light: git tracks changesets instead of tracking content.
- Its distributed, so you don't need to attach to the server (work on the plane).

!SLIDE
# How to install Git
- Use Brew, not ports
- Use GitX
- setting up w/ gitconfig

# Working Alone

!SLIDE
# Hello World with Git
- start with `git init`

!SLIDE
## Working w/ code
  - `git status`
  - `git log`

!SLIDE
## Committing code: First commit
  - `git add`
  - `git commit`
  - `git push`

!SLIDE
## Committing code: Second commit
  - `git add`
  - `git commit`
  - `git push`

!SLIDE
## Staging and pushing
  - `git remote`
  - `git push`

!SLIDE
## Getting code
  - what's github?
  - `git clone`
  - `git pull`
  - `git fetch`

!SLIDE
## Working w/ Branches
  - `git stash`
  - `git branch`

!SLIDE
## Working w/ code 2: committing code with others
  - `git checkout`
  - `git blame`
  - `git merge`
  - `get rebase`

!SLIDE
